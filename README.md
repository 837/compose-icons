## Icon Packs

| Icon pack | Dependency | Code accessor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Simple-Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) | TODO | SimpleIcons |
| [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) | TODO | FeatherIcons |
| [Tabler Icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) | TODO | TablerIcons |

## How the project works

The project uses Kotlin Scripting (main.kts) to download and generate the icons into Compose source code, to generate the source code it uses the tooling library [svg-to-compose](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/svg-to-compose).
